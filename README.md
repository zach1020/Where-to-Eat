# Where to Eat
A python script that picks a restaurant nearby when you can't decide where to eat

## Don't Forget
- You need to enter the **name of your town** in the `where_to_eat.py` file for it to work. 
- You need to enter your **Google Maps API key** in the `where_to_eat.py` file for it to work. Instructions for getting an API key are [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key).
